          <p>The <b>Fresh Expressions</b> "Temple Project" in Eymet started in August 2014, and continues to grow!</p>
          <p><b>"Fresh Expressions"</b> seeks to transform communities and individuals through championing, resourcing and multiplying new ways of being church. We work with Christians from a broad range of denominations and traditions and the movement has resulted in thousands of new congregations being formed alongside more traditional churches.</p>
          <p><b>The Team comprises of 2 Worship Leaders in training from the Chaplaincy of Aquitaine, Allan and Julia Petchey working in collaboration with the Eglise Protestant Unie de France</b>. The aim of the Project is to raise awareness of the Christian faith in Eymet by engaging with local English and French communities.</p>
          <p><b>A weekly Prayer and Coffee “open door” is undertaken on Thursday afternoon 14:00 until 15:00</b>. There is an advertised schedule of Contemporary worship 10:30 Sunday morning: always the 2nd Sunday alongside other services. The 5th Sunday is always a Communion Service lead by the Pastor. Services are for one hour and followed by Tea and Coffee.</p>
          <p><b>Contemporary services are held at the Temple every Sunday at 10:30am, in English with some French translations</b>.The service is projected on screen and the music is modern presented either by a band, musician or ipod. The Communion Service is conducted in French with some English translation. Services are open to all age groups and there are activities for children.</p>
          <p>An activity table is available for children.  Refreshments follow all services.  A collection will be taken to help fund work to be done on the building and to meet expenses.  Toilets are available at the Café des Arts.</p>
          <p><b>The Temple provides a flexible space for worship</b> and life’s key events of Baptism, Marriage or Bereavement. Enquiries or information about faith and the gospel of Christ are most welcome. Whatever stage you are on life’s journey you will find a warm welcome at the Temple in Eymet.</p>
