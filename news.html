            <h3>Winter news and updates</h3>
              <p>Once again our focus has been on “heating” as the Temple has none and it does make the winter services a challenge. We move to our winter quarters over the Tourist Information Office from January until it warms up again in March but this has logistical problems for music and sound equipment. Hence our first Christmas Artisan Sale was aimed at raising money for the Fabric Fund; our aim is to have heating installed before winter 2019. We had a steady stream of people come in all day and the team raised nearly 300 €. Our Team of Anne, Jane, Sue, Mandy, Ginny, Svetlanna, Jill, Marion and a host of others made the day a success and likely to be repeated.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Christmas was busy with a number of visitors, in particular some Americans who enjoyed the singing, welcome and fellowship at the Temple. Although there was no joint service with the Catholic Church this year we do hope that this will be remedied for 2019 as the Community do enjoy coming together ecumenically.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In the run up to Christmas Eymet Temple completed another Faith Encounters series, this time based on “We Bought A Zoo”. We also had a number of Men’s and Ladies Breakfast’s that took place on a Saturday morning giving people a chance to share their faith and views. The Breakfast’s will start again later in the New Year along with a new Faith Encounters Course based on the film “Invictus”. The Core Reflection Group will also be meeting in January to consider how the previous few months went. Prayer and Coffee continues in the Temple every Thursday 2pm until 3pm followed by music practice.</p>
